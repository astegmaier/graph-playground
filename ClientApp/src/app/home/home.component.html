<h1>Graph Playround</h1>
<p>You can use this app as a way to experiment with the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/graph">Microsoft Graph API</a>. It is based on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/angular">Angular + ASP.NET Core Template</a>, it uses <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js">MSAL</a> to authenticate against both consumer and business accounts.</p>

<p>There are two ways that it can make calls to the graph:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Through the <a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript">Graph SDK</a> (see services/graph-sdk.service.ts in the source code): </li>
  <p><button (click)='callGraphWithGraphClient()'>Click to make a simple Graph SDK Call and log results to the console.</button></p>
  <li>Through the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/http">angular http client</a> (see services/graph.service.ts in the source code): </li>
  <p><button (click)='callGraphWithHttpClient()'>Click to make a simple call to the graph with the builtin Angular HTTP client and log results to the console.</button></p>
</ol>

It also uses the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types">microsoft-graph-types</a> library to provide strong typing for the objects returned from the graph.
